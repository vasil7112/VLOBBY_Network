VLOBBY Network
==============
##### Stage: PRE-ALPHA  

Vlobby Network is an upcomming project created by vasil7112. Vlobby Network is a website aimed at Trading, Playing, Talking and Beting on games. We are aiming to create an open-source website that can help both the Community and Developers. 

##Developers
The developers can contribute to Vlobby's Network source by visiting https://github.com/vasil7112/VLOBBY_Network/tree/dev . Mini-Games, Better Class Designs, performance upgrades are examples of how a developer can contribute to the project.

##Community
The community can contribute to Vlobby's Network by visiting https://github.com/vasil7112/VLOBBY_Network or http://vlobby.net/ . Feedback, Ideas, Bugs are examples of how the community can contribute to the project.

##Why does this project exist and why shall i contribute?
Yes, we are aware that there are plenty of sites offering Trading/Talking/Beting or even playing Minigames about most of the Valve's Games. This project though goes beyond a functionality of a website and it is more as an "experiment". My name is Vasilis Dimitriadis (aka vasil7112), and i am currently a young Developer at the age of 16. I believe that the best way to learn better code development, design and functionality is through mutual help of the community and the developers. I am hoping that through this project, i can learn more about what the community needs, but at the same time learn alot of helpful information, performance tunning, tips and tricks in general. At the same time i can experience with other people the advantages of teamwork, and most probably find people who are as passionate about Code Development as me.
There is no reason to contribute if you do not want to, but i would apprieciate if you did. After all this project was started by me, but i want it to be completed by the community. Because the community is the power that will keep this project alive.

Thanks alot for reading this thread, and i hope for the best.

The project is still at PRE-ALPHA, not alot things have been added and the project won't be finished lightning-fast, but small steps will finally finish it.

Merry Christmas to everybody and i hope that you had a wonderful year.
